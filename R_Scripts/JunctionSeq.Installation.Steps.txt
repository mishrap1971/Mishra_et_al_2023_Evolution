JunctionSeq runs on pretty old versions of R and its dependencies need to be of similarly-aged
versions as well. Here, I performed analysis on R v3.5, which is available on most Compute Canada servers. 
JunctionSeq is of version 1.4.0, installed using BioConductor version 3.4. The dependencies 
largely correspond to this version of BioConductor, or are from a similar time period.

1. Invoking R v3.5 on server:
module load CCEnv
module load StdEnv
module load java
R
(you'll get a prompt following this, select the appropriate R version from the available options)

2. Install devtools in R enviroment; this is needed to install the old package versions
install.packages(devtools)

2. Installing required packages; the following packages need to be of an appropriately old
version for JunctionSeq to install (I used R.3.5.1)

devtools::install_version("latticeExtra", repos="https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/", version="0.6-28")

devtools::install_version("locfit", repos="https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/", version="0.6-28")

devtools::install_version("Hmisc", repos="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.5/bioc", version="4.1-1")

devtools::install_version("DESeq2", repos="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.4/bioc", version="1.14.1")

3. Install JunctionSeq
devtools::install_version("JunctionSeq", repos="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.4/bioc", version="1.4.0")
